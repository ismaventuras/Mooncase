# Mooncase

Mooncase is a project made for the DoraHacks and the Moonbeam Foundation hackathon with the intention of creating a web application to display and share NFTs created on the Moonriver network.

## Features

- NFT Search bar : look for your favourite collection by address or nft by name
- Collection display : View all token ids for each collection
- NFT Display : Check an NFT details including its metadata.
- Name resolver : assign a name for an nft in a smart contract that can be used by any app on moonriver network.
